# NodeFarm

The Node Farm project is an introductory Node.js application that demonstrates fundamental concepts such as file reading/writing, routing, and serving HTML templates. It showcases a simple web server that provides information about various farm products.

## Features

- Serves a list of farm products with details such as name, origin, nutrients, quantity, and price.
- Implements routing to handle different URLs and serve appropriate HTML content.
- Utilizes Node.js core modules like `fs`, `http`, and `url` for file operations, server creation, and URL parsing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rutuja1923/Node-Farm.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd node-farm
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the server using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

By default, the server will run on port 8000. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

## Usage
